<p>Technology has proven to be the driving force and catalyst for innovation in a variety of different fields. One of those fields in which it has had a major impact on is the healthcare and medical fields. These fields have been around for as long as any of us can remember, but there is no denying the huge changes that technology has led to. The healthcare field in the modern day looks vastly different compared to what it used to, even only a few short decades ago. With that in mind, this article is going to look at a few of the different ways that technology is changing the medical and healthcare fields.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-creation-of-medical-devices">Efficient Creation of Medical Devices</h2>

<p>Whether you are getting surgery, getting an X-ray or simply doing your annual check up, your doctor is likely using a multitude of different tools throughout your appointment. And those devices and tools need to be created somewhere, and technology has not only improved the quality of these devices, but also their efficiency and cost effectiveness. Companies and providers (such as <a href="https://www.weiss-aug.com/insert-molding/">Weiss-Aug.com</a>) have been creating these devices for decades and as technology advances, so are the methods they use. With technological advancements, the types of tools many doctors use now simply wouldn’t exist.</p>

<h2 id="improving-disease-control">Improving Disease Control</h2>

<p>Managing, classifying and simply keeping track of the various diseases and illnesses out in the world has never been easier than it is today. There exist databases out there with thousands of data points (such as causes of illness, symptoms, remedies and more) that help classify and control diseases. Overall, this type of software can help medical professionals to be able to research and track useful data on how to fight certain diseases, what to watch out for and simply provide better healthcare for everyone involved.</p>

<h2 id="helps-everyone-be-more-informed">Helps Everyone Be More Informed</h2>

<p>In the past, most people were clueless about what their symptoms meant, what certain diseases and illnesses were, and more. This led to a lot of doctors visits that were for something extremely mild. However, with the advancement of the internet, individuals now know more about their health than ever before. Many of us can search the internet for our symptoms and within minutes can know what is wrong with us and what might have caused it. Of course, this increased knowledge shouldn’t stop you from visiting and/or reaching out to a doctor, as they still ultimately know more and can give you a proper diagnosis.</p>

<h2 id="more-efficient-medical-record-keeping">More Efficient Medical Record Keeping</h2>

<p>In the past, medical records were kept on paper and transfering that from doctor to doctor or hospital to hospital could be a bit of a pain. However, we’re willing to bet that the last time you were in a doctor or medical professionals office, they referenced a computer screen for your medical records, not a piece of paper. This is because most of the medical records out there have been digitized. This not only makes it much easier to send to other parties, but having the data, records and information digitally saved and kept is often more secure than keeping a simple paper copy.</p>

<h2 id="improved-and-more-efficient-communication">Improved and More Efficient Communication</h2>

<p>Because of their extremely busy work schedules and a small amount of free time, doctors can be notoriously difficult to reach out and contact. This means you may never actually talk to your doctor other than briefly at each appointment, and often a nurse or secretary will do most of the communicating with you. However, technology is changing that and bringing the doctor and their patients closer than ever before. There are a variety of different social networks out there that aim to connect patients and doctors digitally to take, host Q and A’s and do so much more. Also, due to the vast improvements in digital communications (over traditional methods like email and phone calls), getting a hold of doctors isn’t quite as painstaking as it used to be. In conclusion, these are just some of the many different ways that technology has changed and will continue to change the healthcare world. As technology continues to advance, we will surely see even more changes in the field, changes that could revolutionize the world.</p>

    <h2 class="card-title">How Doctors Use Technology to Treat More Patients</h2>
    <p class="card-text">The mandated implementation of electronic health records systems - EHRs for short - has drastically changed the way doctors manage their practices. The inherent efficiencies of digitally tracking patients have led to the ability for doctors to see more patients in a given amount of time. Furthermore, it lets them forgo many of the formalities and redundancies associated with traditional medical care in exchange for a “hit the ground running” approach to patient care and outcomes.</p>
