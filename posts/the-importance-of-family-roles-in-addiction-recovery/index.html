<p>Addiction is an issue which affects the whole community. Because even if you’re not addicted to drugs, you’re affected in a way as a family member of a relative. That’s why when a member is drug addict, its effects are reflected in the whole family system, as each member tries to cope with the instability and strange behaviors. While some families may deny the reality to cope with situation, others face the situation head-on and try to understand their role in addiction recovery, hence bringing the household in complete sobriety. The support of a family is critical during addiction recovery. The process may not take days, or even few years to cure, and it therefore calls for unrelenting efforts of support (who else apart from family members?) Below are ways a spouse, a friend, or relative can help a loved one in their journey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction_recovery_groups">addiction recovery</a>.</p>

<h2 id="family-therapy"><strong>Family Therapy</strong></h2>

<p>Organizing family therapies and inviting the addicted members can significantly hasten their recovery process. Since addiction can substantially tear family relationships and develop big rifts, participating in family therapy can help mitigate the effects, or better yet, restore health family relationships. It&rsquo;s during these family therapies that members get to understand the situation of their loved one as a long-time condition. This prepares them to figure out the appropriate efforts to help their loved one; efforts that won&rsquo;t die soon when no signs of cure.</p>

<h2 id="co-dependence"><strong>Co-Dependence</strong></h2>

<p>Co-dependence occurs when you develop certain unhealthy behaviors as a result of trying to cope with the dysfunction in the family unit. When you’re co-dependent, you’re likely to get so involved in the recovering of your loved one that you don’t attend to your personal needs and wants.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some behaviors of co-dependency include;</li>
<li>Excessive worry about the loved one&rsquo;s substance abuse, often leading to stress</li>
<li>Avoiding people from outside the family in an attempt to prevent discussion about the matter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/definition-of-denial-22200">Denying the reality</a> about the situation of your loved one</li>
<li>Neglecting your physical, emotional and spiritual needs due to solely concentrating on the situation of your loved one</li>
<li>Low self-esteem, due to close attachment with your loved one</li>
<li>Unreasonable anger as a result of your loved one’s situation mostly redirected to others</li>
<li>Engaging in unhealthy compulsive behaviors like eating, long walks, etc</li>
<li>Making your moods dependent on your loved ones</li>
<li>Supporting the behaviors of your loved one, so long as it makes them happy</li>
</ul>

Some include and not limited to dealing with factors that lead to drug abuse, emotions, resentment, frustrations and anger among others. When the family addresses these issues, they will end up creating a conducive environment for addiction recovery.</p>

<h2 id="relapse-prevention"><strong>Relapse Prevention</strong></h2>

<p>Engaging in recovery process for your loved one is a good thing, but keeping your expectations in check is essential. You should always note that addiction is a chronic condition, and relapse can happen along the way. This is however not to mean that your loved one will never recover someday, but instead in need of additional time to cope with triggers and urges. You can help your loved one overcome relapse by being aware of relapse signals such as withdrawing from <a href="https://www.namistl.org/support-groups/family-support-group/">family support groups</a>, exposing themselves to triggers, struggling with stress and depression, being defensive to any change reinforced upon them. Get to understand them, and instead of getting yourself stressed, you will end up being there for them in their journey to recovery. In many cases, the cases around drug addiction may create severe rifts in the family set up. A family should step in and address such problems and increase the chances of recovery. When these issues remain unsolved, the chances of recovery are greatly reduced. When the family adequately addresses these issues, an addict can easily achieve recovery goals faster.

Though addiction is one an individual’s disease, the recovery is a family process.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Information that’s accessible regarding patients is increasing by the day. And we have access to a lot of this data at our fingerprints thanks to advances in technology. We should be able to draw insights from this and put data to work. The first challenge is the huge amount of data that cannot be processed by mere mortals. Machine learning when combined with data can help us make better decisions, transform healthcare, save lives and improve the quality of life.</p>
