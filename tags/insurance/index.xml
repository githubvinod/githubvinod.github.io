      <description>Heidelberg 15.03.2018 - Getsafe is now offering developers an API for integrating insurance products into third-party apps, the first to include health insurance options.
Through Getsafeâ€™s new API, healthcare providers such as medical offices are now able to offer easily accessible health insurance products to their patients, particularly those who avoid booking much-needed appointments because of high costs. Patients now have an easy way to get instant coverage prior to booking their appointment, avoiding potentially costly surprises after their procedure.</description>
