      <description>When writing content for your blog the first concern you should have is attracting readers! Well especially when you are writing about healthcare, this is only possible if your blog has high rankings in the search engines. Search engine optimization is essential and if you&amp;rsquo;re not listed on the first page of search results the number of people viewing your blog goes down. Modern search engine optimization is not driven by keywords but by useful content.</description>
