      <description>Whether you are IBM Watson or some other AI system, you seek to find answers to questions that humans can&amp;rsquo;t answer quickly or analytically.
 What&amp;rsquo;s the likelihood of this autoimmune disease in that patient? What does the latest evidence say about this treatment protocol for that cancer? From which zip codes will the next generation of asthma patients come from?  When we ask such cognitive (thinking) questions, there&amp;rsquo;s a big underlying assumption.</description>

      <description>Information that’s accessible regarding patients is increasing by the day. And we have access to a lot of this data at our fingerprints thanks to advances in technology. We should be able to draw insights from this and put data to work. The first challenge is the huge amount of data that cannot be processed by mere mortals. Machine learning when combined with data can help us make better decisions, transform healthcare, save lives and improve the quality of life.</description>

      <description>The use of machine learning and AI is growing at a rapid rate in the healthcare sector, being able to tackle tasks many thought wouldn’t be possible just yet. Google researchers are doing just that by teaching a AI algorithm to detect common forms of blindness, specifically diabetic retinopathy—which affects almost a third of diabetes patients, as effectively as real-life trained ophthalmologist. What is diabetic retinopathy? Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes related complication that affects the eyes, caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).</description>

      <description>Research shows that there is an increase of chronic diseases globally. In case of an outbreak of an infectious disease like Ebola, there is usually a rapid spread throughout the entire world. We must find ways of handling the quick spread of outbreaks to reduce the number of people who might contract the disease. In recent years, researchers have made advancements in detecting and diagnosing of chronic diseases, thus reducing overall treatment costs.</description>

      <description>There’s nothing quite as great looking as a full head of lustrous hair. Great hair is very attractive to other people, but the reality is that many men tend to lose their hair as life goes on.
