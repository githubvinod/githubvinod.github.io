      <description>Credit reports hold a lot of valuable information about us and our day-to-day. They show our paying history, our debt, our loans, bills that we have, or haven&amp;rsquo;t, paid on time, and the number of credit cards or accounts that we have opened up under our name. While credit reports can be a great asset, they also can contain information that can prove to make purchases or obtaining loans a lot more difficult.</description>
