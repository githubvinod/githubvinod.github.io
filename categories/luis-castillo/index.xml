      <description>Last month, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Service (CMS) released its final rule, which dramatically changes bundled payment requirements for many organizations. The rule cancels the hip fracture and cardiac bundled payment models that were set to launch on Jan. 1, 2018, as well as diminishes the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model. Now the rule requires only 34 geographic areas to participate in CJR instead of the previously-mandated 67The remaining areas will have the option to voluntarily take part going forward.</description>
