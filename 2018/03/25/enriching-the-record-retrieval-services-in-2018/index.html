Multiple record retrieval companies provide retrieval services to claim assistants, also attorneys and medical professionals as well. Complying to the HIPAA norms, processing, and handling required documents including, but not limited to authorization to release medical records, notices, notice of privacy practices, these record retrieval companies collect medical documents either manually, electronically using faxes or emails and even directly accessing EMR for document downloads. These companies put a lot of effort into collecting documents from various locations and dispatching to the right claim companies or law firms. A lot of data is collected with every such activity.</p>
