<h2 id="how-can-i-beat-the-trauma"><strong>How Can I Beat the Trauma?</strong></h2>

<p>We have packaged five tips on how to overcome psychological trauma. If you can follow our tips effectively and faithfully, you would beat the trauma. The following are the tips:</p>

<p><strong>1. Use the Latest Trauma Beating Technology</strong></p>

<p>There are hundreds of ways of dealing with trauma, but usually, only a handful will work for individuals. One of the most powerful ways to deal with trauma is exposure therapy. However, certain traumas are hard to be exposed to. For example, how do you “expose” a combat veteran to enough stimulation to help him get over having his best friend gunned down? How do you “expose” an assault victim to enough stimulation to help them get over the beating?</p>

<p>This is where technology comes in.</p>

<p>The rise of virtual reality and reality augmentation gear has created new ways of dealing with trauma. As NBC news reported, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/innovation/how-virtual-reality-helping-heal-soldiers-ptsd-n733816">veterans with severe PTSD showed significant improvement after just 30 days of exposure therapy in a virtual world</a>. The treatment was extremely powerful because it gave veterans enough stimulation to relive the memories over and over but in a healing way rather than a damaging one.</p>

<p>Researches are still exploring the scope of virtual realities and their potential in dealing with trauma. If you have the resources and opportunity to try it out, begin with the latest technologies.</p>

<p>But if not, we will cover some holistic ways to recover as well.</p>

<p>At this period, you may have the urge to isolate yourself from others and stay indoors.  You may see everyone as your enemy. You may even find it hard to communicate with people without remembering the horrific image.</p>

<p>Do not give in to the thought of staying alone. Isolation will only worsen the situation and may prompt you to start having some suicidal thought.</p>

<p>Go out, and connect with the people in your inner circle. Research shows that relationship helps reduce psychological trauma.</p>

<p>Participate in games and other social activities. Play, Laugh and enjoy the company of others. The more you do this, the more you relax your mind will be.</p>

<p>This tip, although small is the most powerful and usually the most overlooked. To truly conquer psychological trauma, you have to beat the inertia that holds you back from going to social situations.</p>

<p>Psychological trauma will make you lose your self-control. You may find it hard to control your actions. In fact, things like crying will become naturally uncontrollable. For you to overcome this, you need to learn how to calm yourself.</p>

<p>For you to calm yourself, you can breathe in and out or listen to soothing music. In addition to this, you can choose to rest or sleep for you to be calm and take your mind off the situation.</p>

<p>Mindfulness meditation is a powerful tool for self control. It is show to dramatically increase in emotionally stability along with reducing stress and increasing creativity. To start practicing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sit down somewhere comfortable.</li>
<li>Set a timer on your phone (5 - 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Relax your body and keep your eyes open.</li>
<li>Breath through your nose.</li>
<li>Focus your mind on the cold air coming in, the pause between your breaths and the cold air blowing out.</li>
<li>You will have thoughts, so, do not resist them. Let them pass through. Do not judge them as good or bad, just let them carry through.</li>
</ol>

<p>Mindfulness meditation is so powerful that <a href="https://oneminddharma.com/simple-workouts-to-be-mindful">it can even be coupled with exercise</a>.</p>

<p>Psychological trauma will make you lose your sleep. It will make you vulnerable to diseases. You need to be more concerned about your health. You should not let the trauma affect you. In fact, you should ensure that you sleep daily for up to 9 hours.</p>

<p>In addition to this, you should avoid alcohol or drugs. They can worsen your symptoms instead of making your better.</p>

<p>At this point, you will lose the appetite to eat. However, it is important for you to eat always. Eat a balanced diet and make sure that you avoid sugary substance. Meditate and embrace yoga if possible.</p>

<p><strong>2. Regulate the Material You Consume</strong></p>

<p>Research shows that constant exposure to the images or videos of a traumatic event on the media could go a long way in worsening the case of an individual that is suffering from psychological trauma.</p>

<p>You should learn how to limit your exposure to the traumatic event. Do not watch videos or news that can expose you to traumatic events. In fact, you should avoid watching “disturbing videos.” The more you watch them, the more you will be traumatized.</p>

<p>Exercise, they say is vital in the human body. It helps in burning excessive sugar and adrenaline. It also releases endorphins and relaxes the nervous system.</p>

<p>As a psychologically traumatized person, you need to relax your nervous system so that you can recover on time.</p>

<p>Do not be passive. Move your body. While you move your body, make sure that you feel the freedom the movement gives.</p>

<p>In addition to this, you can swim, dance, play basketball or even walk. As you do this, you will see some sensation around your body and breathe. Pay attention to your breath and movement.</p>

<p>Exercise for at least thirty minutes. You can also choose to split the workout into three periods per day for you to have an optimized result.</p>

<p>By experimenting with these tips, you will set yourself on a path for a healthier and easier lifestyle. The greatest obstacle you will face is inertia and laziness. Do what it takes to execute these on these tips. However, if you find out that the trauma is more intense, you can contact a trauma specialist for a checkup.</p>
